Using our knowledge gained from the past six modules we have developed a real-world front-end application that can be showcased to potential employers. This application takes full advantage of two server-side APIs, based around Rick & Morty, as well as cocktails! A user will be presented a page titled \"The Creepy Morty\", as well as a \"Start Quiz\" button. A modal will be displayed to provide the user a set of instructions. Afterwhich the user will need to go through a series of cocktail ingredients, and after completion, a card of a cocktail as well as a Rick & Morty character are displayed! Each with a unique description and/or details.",
